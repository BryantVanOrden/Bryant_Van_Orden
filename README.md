# DS350_Template

Welcome to DS 350 - Data Wrangling and Visualization.

Hi I am Bryant Van Orden. Sorry I am not using the repository I should be but I was never added to the github so I had to clone it myself. 
I am a Softmore and I have been interning with the church with their database team since January. 
I was able to do so because me and my friend Preston one the hack-a-thon last semester and they offered us interviews even though we were freshmen. 
I just got married less then a month ago. Just moved into married housing. I'm working part time for the church and taking a full load of programming classes.
